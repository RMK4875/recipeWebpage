The Olivia Pesto Chicken Sandwich

Ingredients:
4 each             Rustic bread rolls, split
4 ounces         Provolone cheese, sliced
4 ounces         Mozzarella cheese, deli-style loaf, sliced
½ cup              Sundried Tomato Pesto (homemade or your favorite store-bought brand)
3 ounces         Fresh Baby Spinach 
2 ounces         Sweet Basil, fresh, leaves picked from stems
12 ounces       Roasted chicken breast, seasoned, cooled
1/4 cup           Mayonnaise
1/4 cup           Basil Pesto (homemade or your favorite store-bought brand

Instructions:

Fold together the mayonnaise and the basil pesto. Split the Telera rolls in half. Spread the first half of each roll with the pesto mayo. Spread the second half of each roll with the tomato pesto. Shingle 3 ounces of the sliced chicken breast on the bottom half of each sandwich. Place ½ ounce of basil leaves on top of the chicken on each sandwich. Place ¾ ounces (a small handful) of spinach leaves on top of the basil. Drape a slice of provolone and a slice of mozzarella over the spinach. Set your oven to 400 degrees and place a rack in the center. Bake the sandwiches on a cookie sheet, open-faced, until the cheese begins to melt and the sandwich warms slightly, about 8-9 minutes. Put the top of the roll on and serve immediately.



Story:

Our founder’s daughter, Olivia, joined our café team when she was 16. After talking with some regular customers, she felt we needed a pesto chicken sandwich. After many conversations with her mom and what she felt was slow progress on the R&D front, Olivia decided to take matters into her own hands and create a prototype of the sandwich. She presented the sandwich to the Gourmondo chef team for consideration, and the Olivia sandwich was born.
