    <h2>The Story of the Olivia Pesto Chicken Sandwich</h2>
    <p>Our founder’s daughter, Olivia, joined our café team when she was 16. After talking with some regular customers, she felt we needed a pesto chicken sandwich. After many conversations with her mom and what she felt was slow progress on the R&D front, Olivia decided to take matters into her own hands and create a prototype of the sandwich. She presented the sandwich to the Gourmondo chef team for consideration, and the Olivia sandwich was born.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>4 each           Rustic bread rolls, split</li>
      <li>4 ounces         Provolone cheese, sliced</li>
      <li>4 ounces         Mozzarella cheese, deli-style loaf, sliced</li>
      <li>½ cup            Sundried Tomato Pesto (homemade or your favorite store-bought brand)</li>
      <li>3 ounces         Fresh Baby Spinach</li>
      <li>2 ounces         Sweet Basil, fresh, leaves picked from stems
      <li>12 ounces        Roasted chicken breast, seasoned, cooled</li>
      <li>1/4 cup          Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1/4 cup          Basil Pesto (homemade or your favorite store-bought brand)</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Fold together the mayonnaise and the basil pesto. </li>
      <li>Split the Telera rolls in half. Spread the first half of each roll with the pesto mayo.</li>
      <li>Spread the second half of each roll with the tomato pesto. Shingle 3 ounces of the sliced chicken breast on the bottom half of each sandwich.</li>
      <li>Place ½ ounce of basil leaves on top of the chicken on each sandwich. Place ¾ ounces (a small handful) of spinach leaves on top of the basil. </li>
      <li>Drape a slice of provolone and a slice of mozzarella over the spinach. </li>
      <li>Set your oven to 400 degrees and place a rack in the center.</li>
      <li>Bake the sandwiches on a cookie sheet, open-faced, until the cheese begins to melt and the sandwich warms slightly, about 8-9 minutes.</li>
      <li>Put the top of the roll on and serve immediately.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
